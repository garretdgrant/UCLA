    "### Python variables review:\n",
    "- Recall that variables in Python are names (or identifiers) bound to objects (things in memory)\n",
    "- Variables do not need to be declared, but instead are created when initialized\n",
    "- Assignment via the '=' operator binds a name on the left to an object on the right, e.g., x = \"hello\" binds the variable x to the word \"hello\". Assignment such as x=y binds the variable x to the same object as y is bound to, i.e., x and y at the current time are different names for the same object. The assignment operator never copies data!\n",
    "- Certain objects are immutable (their value cannot be changed, e.g., ints)) while others are mutable (their value can be changed, e.g., lists). To change a mutable object a mutation has to be called via one of its names, e.g., x.append(3), says append 3 to the object (a list) which x is bound to."

    "- Functions except arguments which are assigned to its parameters: parameters are local variables created when a function is called. Functions may return one or more objects.\n",
    "- Lambda expressions are a convenient way of defining simple functions\n",
    "- Recall that a variable's scope refers to the regions in a program in which it is recognized / can be referenced.\n",
    "- Somewhat confusingly, we also refer to the scope of certain sections of a program, e.g., the local scope associated with a function. A function or class method creates a local scope when it is called, which consists of a set of local variables which exist only during the runtime of the function. Python is often referred to as having function level scoping: unlike C++, local scope are not created for if statements, while loops or for loops (C++ is often referred to as having block level scoping).\n",
    "- When a variable, e.g., x, is referenced in Python has to have some way of resolving which variable x you are referring to. Scopes are organized into a hierarchy of dictionaries or namespaces, consisting of key-value pairs corresponding to variable name - variable value/ object. Name resolution is carried out by searching these namespaces in order Local-Enclosing-Global-Builtin (LEGB)"

    "- A class is a template for constructing particular objects. A class is itself an instance of a general template or class object. An example might be as follows: a car is built from a blueprint (the class you write!), but a blueprint also usually follows a certain template (e.g. there is a specification section, a list of components etc.). The point is that a class is itself an object as well as the instances of said object.\n",
    "- Classes can be viewed as bundles of variables and methods. Each instance of a class will have a version of the class variables stated in the class definition, unless reassigned these will all be bound to the same object. An instance of a class may also have instance variables which are by default unique to it. The distinction between instance and class variables are quite artificial, but one can think of all class instances must have the class variable, but don't necessarily have to have the same instance variables. Also, although class variable names are initially all bound to the same object, this is not the case for instance variables\n",
    "- The self keyword is placeholder for instance of the class in question (see example below).\n",
    "- Magic methods allow you to define natural ways in which to manipulate instances of a class, e.g., aadd or multiply them, print them etc.\n",
    "- Inheritance allows you to build classes of other classes, saving time and effort. A subclass will inherit those attributes and methods of the superclass which it does not overwrite. The super() command is a good way of being explicit when it comes to extending and adjusting the method of a superclass to a subclass. \n",
    "- An iterators is a class which allows you to create an object facilitating the iteration through the elements or variables (i.e., returning them one at a time) of an instance of another class. For iteration to occur the class in question needs to have an iter() method, which return an instance of the iterator class, and the iterator class a next() method.\n",
    "- Generators are an alterantive way of performing iteration over the elements of a class object: these have a syntax similar to functions but replace the return statement with yield.\n",

    "##### Classes iterators and generators checklist\n",

    "- Do you understand the difference between class vs an instance variable?\n",
    "- Can you define magic methods and use them to introduce some notion of addition between members of a class (think back to the groceries example where created a new class which essentially allowed us to add two instance of a subclass of a dictionary)\n",
