    "# Functions and modules\n",
    "In this lecture we will review the material covered in the tutorials on the basics of functions in python and modules. We'll basically practise writing a load of functions to do various things and then look at a couple of examples of things you can do with SciPy, another python module available through Anaconda. But first a short class quiz! Which of the following are True or False?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can define functions to only except either positional or keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The order of keyword arguments when calling a function does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The scope of a variable is the parts of a program in which it can be accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Namespaces in Python are used to modularize code and control variable scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Global variables cannot be accessed inside of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Global variables cannot be changed inside of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) A local variable cannot be accessed outside of the function in which it is defined.\n",
