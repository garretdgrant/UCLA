In the same way 'x' is a common choice of variable name that we use in maths all the time, its nice to be able to reuse variable names when we program. This is particularly true when we consider importing in other peoples functions and modules (which we will cover later). Namespaces also allow one to modularise your code, enabling you to create specific and independent environments for performing certain pieces of functionality. Each function when called creates a local namespace."

What this means is that when I try to access or use a variable <code>x</code> say, Python will use the first variable <code>x</code> it finds. Python will first look for <code>x</code> in the local namespace, if it can't find it there it proceeds to look in the Enclosing namespace, then the Global and finally the Built-in. If the variable can't be found anywhere then an error is thrown. Lets see this through the example below."

Here it finds a variable defined called <code>x</code> with value 10 and so uses this. When <code>z</code> is called inside of f2 Python finds no variable with that name in either the local or enclosing namespace, but does find a variable <code>z</code> with value 3 in the global namespace, so uses that.
